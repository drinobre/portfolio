    fullDescription:
      "We were assigned to teams of four in week nine of the SoC bootcamp and our task was to solve a problem that bootcampers have. On the first day, we planned the project as a team and we decided to build an app for bootcampers to get to know more about each other. In the following days, we were divided into pairs and I was responsible for leading the backend and helping solve issues on the front-end. During the week, we learnt how to effectively work as a team, how to use git branches, deploy on Netlify and Heroku and how resilient we were as a team.",
