      "During the Christmas break we are assigned the task of creating anything we would like. As I wasn't feeling very confident on backend I decided to deep dive on the backend using Node.js. I have lot of challenges to overcome but I believe the results have pay-off. I've used Express wireframe, environment variables to secure the Database credentials and create the GET and POST requests to access the postgres Database. Note the design was outsourced as it wasn't the aim of the project work on CSS.",
