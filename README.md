# Objective

Create a multi-page APP where users can find out more who I'm outside my professional life and my professional journey. Users will be also able to see some of my projects.

## Designing Thinking process

The first version of my portifolio was created in the week 7 of the School of Code and the approach was very much reflecting my previous carrer. However, I decided to make significant amends on the design after the week 12, where I believe it's better describe who I'm after the bootcamper experience.

## Technical requirements

I've choosen to build this APP using Next.JS rather than React.JS. for SEO reasons.

## Components Tree

- App
  -- Image with text (right/left)
  -- Title + Video + text
  -- Title + Image + text

## Implementation Plan

- Install (Next.js)[https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup] npx create-next-app portifolio

## Learnings

- globals.css vs Home.module.module.css:
  - should I create the CSS by page? Or can I add on the global?
