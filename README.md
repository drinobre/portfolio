# Objective

Create a multi-page APP where users can find out more who I'm outside my professional life, my professional journey and latest projects.

## Designing Thinking process

The first version of my portifolio was created in the week 7 of the School of Code(SoC) and the approach was very much reflecting my previous carrer. However, I decided to make some amends on the design after the week 12, where I believe it's better describe who I'm after the bootcamper experience.

## MVP

- Landing page
  - Image and intro (Component 1)
  - Intro and Image (Component 2)
- Projects
  - Image and Intro (Component 1)
- Contact me
  - links to GitHub, Linkedin (Footer component)

## Technical requirements

I've choosen to build this APP using Next.JS rather than React.JS in order to practice using Next.js and ability to future expansion of the Portifolio for SEO reasons.

## Components Tree

- App
  -- Image with text
  -- Text with Image

## Implementation Plan
